## collaborative modelling with che workspaces

Some ideas to be organised which could be possible when using che workspaces for collaboration on models:

Screen sharing while modelling.

Pre-commit reviews (the review process with workflows like Gerrit can be very confusing for less technical domain experts).

Fast online interaction (e.g. if a model repository such as CDO or Mondo server or EMFStore is also on the same  cluster as the applications, this might help with speed and removes reliance on IP protocols for remote communication...does CDO use IP protocols?).

Snapshots of commits.

Web links to IDE's showing a single commit (eclipse che already does this for code with its 'Factories').

Delegating conflict resolution to someone else for difficult commits.

Easier to understand integration with CI/CD for code generated artifacts.

Integration with openshift.io which plans to link ci/cd/issue tracking and deployment in a presetup environment.
